UserVoice PHP library for API connections
=========================================

This library allows you to easily:
* Generate SSO token for creating SSO users / logging them into UserVoice (http://uservoice.com).
* Do 3-legged and 2-legged UserVoice API calls safely without having to worry about the cryptographic details (unless you want).


Installation
============

For installing OAuth, you should check if your operating system packaging system has PHP OAuth and MCrypt packages available. For example, for PHP 5.4 Homebrew comes with packages php54-oauth and php54-mcrypt. If your packaging systems is unable to install OAuth for PHP, you just need to install
[PECL/PEAR](http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php).


After getting PEAR you should have the command 'pecl' available, so run ([detailed instructions](http://www.php.net/manual/en/oauth.setup.php). Homebrew equivalent: ```brew install php54-oauth```):
```sh
sudo pecl install oauth
```
You also need mcrypt ([detailed instructions](http://www.php.net/manual/en/mcrypt.setup.php). Homebrew equivalent: ```brew install php54-mcrypt```):

When you get mcrypt and oauth installed, specify them in your php.ini* file:
```php
extension=oauth.so
extension=mcrypt.so
```
*\*Note: on some systems, the php.ini file used for the command line interface is separate from the one used in your web server. Make sure that Composer has access to the extensions by configuring the PHP command prompt settings.*

Finally, install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/) and place composer.phar in your PATH. Add uservoice/uservoice in your composer.json:

```javascript
"uservoice/uservoice": ">=0.0.5"
```

Then install project dependencies using Composer:

```sh
composer.phar install
```

Now you should be good to go!


Examples
========

Prerequisites:

* The mcrypt and oauth need to be installed. Check installation instructions above.
* Place the following configuration parameters somewhere in your application:

```php
# Suppose your UserVoice site is at http://uservoice-subdomain.uservoice.com/
$USERVOICE_SUBDOMAIN = 'uservoice-subdomain';
$SSO_KEY = '982c88f2df72572859e8e23423eg87ed'; # Admin Console -> Settings -> General -> User Authentication

# Define an API client at: Admin Console -> Settings -> Channels -> API
$API_KEY = 'oQt2BaunWNuainc8BvZpAm';
$API_SECRET = '3yQMSoXBpAwuK3nYHR0wpY6opE341inL9a2HynGF2';

// Use autoload.php of Composer to use the library and its dependencies:
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

SSO-token generation using uservoice library
--------------------------------------------

SSO-token can be used to create sessions for SSO users. They are capable of synchronizing the user information from one system to another.
Generating the SSO token from SSO key and given uservoice subdomain can be done by calling UserVoice\\SSO::generate\_sso\_token method like this:

```php
<?php
    $sso_token = \UserVoice\SSO::generate_token($USERVOICE_SUBDOMAIN, $SSO_KEY, array(
        'display_name' => "John Doe",
        'email' => 'john.doe@example.com'
    ), 5*60); // the token will be valid for 5 minutes (5*60 seconds) by default

    echo 'https://' . $USERVOICE_SUBDOMAIN . '.uservoice.com/?sso='.$sso_token."\n";
?>
```

Making API calls
----------------

You need to create an instance of UserVoice\\Client. Get $API_KEY and $API_SECRET for an API client which you can create
from Admin Console. Go to Settings -> Channels -> API.

```php
<?

try {
    $client = new \UserVoice\Client($USERVOICE_SUBDOMAIN, $API_KEY, $API_SECRET);

    // Get users of a subdomain (requires trusted client, but no user)
    $users = $client->get_collection("/api/v1/users");

    print "Subdomain \"" . $USERVOICE_SUBDOMAIN . "\" has " . count($users) . " users.\n";

    foreach($users as $user) {
        print("User: \"${user['name']}\", Profile URL: ${user['url']}\n");
    }


    // Now, let's login as mailaddress@example.com, a regular user
    $regular_access_token = $client->login_as('mailaddress@example.com');

    // Example request #1: Get current user.
    $r = $regular_access_token->get("/api/v1/users/current");
    $user = $r['user'];

    print("User: \"${user['name']}\", Profile URL: ${user['url']}\n");

    // Login as account owner
    $owner_access_token = $client->login_as_owner();

    // Example request #2: Create a new private forum limited to only example.com email domain.
    $r = $owner_access_token->post("/api/v1/forums", array(
        'forum' => array(
            'name' => 'PHP Client Private Feedback',
            'private' => true,
            'allow_by_email_domain' => true,
            'allowed_email_domains' => array(
                array('domain' => 'example.com')
            )
        )
    ));
    $forum = $r['forum'];

    print("Forum \"${forum['name']}\" created! URL: ${forum['url']}\n");
} catch (\UserVoice\Unauthorized $e) {
    /* Thrown usually due to faulty tokens, untrusted client or if attempting
     * operations without Admin Privileges
     */
    var_dump($e);
} catch (\UserVoice\NotFound $e) {
    // Thrown when attempting an operation to a resource that does not exist
    var_dump($e);
}

?>
```

Verifying a UserVoice user
--------------------------

If you want to make calls on behalf of a user, but want to make sure he or she
actually owns certain email address in UserVoice, you need to use 3-Legged API
calls. Just pass your user an authorize link to click, so that user may grant
your site permission to access his or her data in UserVoice.

```php
<?php

$callback_url = 'http://localhost:3000/'; # your site

$client = new \UserVoice\Client($USERVOICE_SUBDOMAIN, $API_KEY, $API_SECRET, array('callback' => $callback_url));

# At this point you want to print/redirect to client.authorize_url in your application.
# Here we just output them as this is a command-line example.
print("1. Go to " . $client->authorize_url() . " and click \"Allow access\".\n");
print("2. Then type the oauth_verifier which is passed as a GET parameter to the callback URL:\n");

# In a web app we would get the oauth_verifier via a redirection to CALLBACK_URL.
# In this command-line example we just read it from stdin:
$access_token = $client->login_with_verifier(readline());

# All done. Now we can read the current user's email address:
$r = $access_token->get("/api/v1/users/current");
$user = $r['user'];

print("User logged in, Name: ${user['name']}, email: ${user['email']}\n");

?>
```
